## ASL-LEX ASL-CDI subset 
after parsing the rows from ASL-LEX [@sehyr2021asl] its come to my attention that not all the ASL-CDI [@caselli2020asl] signs are not within it. 

**NOTE:** The CDI we used did not come from an ASL adapted version, but rather the original McAurther-Bates CDI [@fenson2007macarthur]
